## Description

This tool allows you to view the voting record of Sheffield University's Students' Union's Council for the year.

This tool is a proof of concept to show what opportunities for data visualisation and interaction is possible.

## Info

1. Does not display vote by proxy
2. Does not display vote type (STV, etc)

## Known bugs:

1. Doesn't handle councillors who vacate or fill a set half way very well.
2. Unsure what the difference between no vote given, blank and absent.
